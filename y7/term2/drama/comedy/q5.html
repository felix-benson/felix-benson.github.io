    <h2>Charles Chaplin</h2>
    <p>Charles Chaplin is considered to be one of the most significant actors of the early days of Hollywood. He is
        most recognized for being a star of the silent film era. He is often found in films wearing his usual attire of
        a bowler hat, bamboo cane, funny walk and a toothbrush moustache, also known as “The Little Tramp”.
    </p>
    <p>After watching some of his performance, I would describe him as using Overstatement with his exaggerated
        movements and he uses Slapstick comedy very liberally. To me, the exaggerated movement looks very unnatural but
        I suspect they put this to use to overcome the silent films as a medium.</p>
