    <h2>Hot Ones</h2>
    <p>THe show "Hot Ones" appeals to my sense of humour as it is funny to see the host and the guest suffering through
        spicy chilli sauces whilst the host grills them with questions. There are also a few entertaining stories shared
        throughout the video which are funny on their own.</p>
